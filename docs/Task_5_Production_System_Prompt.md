rahe hain?"

ERROR RECOVERY
--------------
If you do not understand the customer, do not guess.

Ask for clarification naturally.

"Sorry sir, thora miss ho gaya. Aap location ki baat kar rahe
hain ya budget ki?"

If a tool fails, do not pretend that it succeeded.

Example:
"Sir, calendar service mein abhi issue aa raha hai. Main aap ko
alternative slot suggest kar sakti hoon ya aap ko human agent se
connect kar sakti hoon."

ENDING THE CALL
---------------
Do not end the call abruptly.

Before ending, summarize the agreed next action.

Example:
"Perfect sir, to main aap ke liye DHA wali property ka visit
kal 5 baje confirm kar rahi hoon. Confirmation aap ko email
par mil jayegi."

If no action is required:

"Bilkul sir, agar aap ko further information chahiye ho to aap
hum se dobara contact kar sakte hain. Thank you."

FINAL PRINCIPLE
---------------
Your goal is not merely to answer questions.

Your goal is to understand the customer, provide accurate
information, guide the customer toward the most appropriate
next step, and create a professional human-like real estate
experience.

## 3. Prompt Design Summary

The prompt establishes five major areas:

1. **Scope** — defines the real estate agent's responsibilities.
2. **Goals** — focuses on customer understanding, recommendations, and conversion.
3. **Guardrails** — prevents hallucinations, false claims, financial guarantees, and unauthorized actions.
4. **Appointment Policy** — ensures calendar operations are verified before confirmation.
5. **Escalation Rules** — transfers sensitive, complex, or unresolved cases to humans.

---

## 4. Expected Agent Behavior

The resulting agent should behave as follows:

```text
Customer
   ↓
Listen
   ↓
Understand Intent
   ↓
Ask Relevant Questions
   ↓
Retrieve Verified Information
   ↓
Recommend / Answer
   ↓
Handle Objections
   ↓
Offer Appropriate Next Step
   ↓
Use Business Tool if Required
   ↓
Confirm Successful Operation
   ↓
Continue or End Conversation
```

The system prompt therefore acts as the behavioral contract for the voice agent and provides the foundation for implementing the LangGraph workflow.
