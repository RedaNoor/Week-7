## Task 2: Conversation Flow Design

### 1. Objective

Design complete conversation flows for buyer, rental, commercial, investment, returning-customer, appointment-rescheduling, and appointment-cancellation scenarios.

The agent should behave like a professional real estate sales representative rather than a conventional chatbot.

### Investment Guardrail

The agent must never guarantee financial returns.

Instead of:

> "Sir, is property ka 30% return guaranteed hai."

Use:

> "Sir, available historical information ke basis par is area mein appreciation hui hai, lekin future returns guarantee nahi kiye ja sakte."

## 9. General Conversation Pattern

All flows should follow a common high-level pattern:

```text
Greeting
   ↓
Intent Detection
   ↓
Requirement Discovery
   ↓
Information Retrieval
   ↓
Recommendation / Answer
   ↓
Objection Handling
   ↓
Next Best Action
   ↓
Appointment / Follow-up
   ↓
Confirmation
   ↓
Conversation End
```

### Design Principles

1. Ask one important question at a time.
2. Avoid long monologues.
3. Confirm important details.
4. Never invent property information.
5. Offer alternatives when requirements cannot be met.
6. Do not pressure customers.
7. Always confirm successful tool execution before reporting success.
8. Escalate complex cases to humans.
9. Maintain context throughout the conversation.
10. End with a clear next step.
